Beggining of the development of a interpreter in Python

First phase completed:
- Developed a simple arithmetic parser with the basic operations and enforced orders (parenthesis and order of the operations)
  - parser.py

Second phase completed:
- Translated the interpreter to use AST to represent the sentences and added unary + and -
  - parserAST.py

Third phase:
- Use the interpreter based on AST to parse Pascal code
 - parserPascal.py
